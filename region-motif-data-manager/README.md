individually by accessing "Search and browse tool sheds" on the Admin UI panel
and searching for "region_motif_data_manager" in the Galaxy main toolshed.
Then, follow the onscreen instructions.

## Running the Data Manager / Installing the Motif Databases

accessing "Manage local data" from the Admin control panel. Under "Run Data 
Manager Tools", select "Install Motif Database." On the following page, choose
the desired database from the dropdown menu and then hit run. The status
of the data manager job can be viewed with "View Data Manager Tools".
